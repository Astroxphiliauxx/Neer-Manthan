## - Creating A Pull Request:


1. Fork the Project


2. Create your Feature Branch

```sh 
git checkout -b feat/AmazingFeature
```
 or Bug Fix Feature `(git checkout -b fix/BugName)`.

3. After cloning the project, run the following command, 

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/astroxphiliauxx/Neer-Manthan.git
```

4. Commit your Changes 
```sh
git commit -m 'Added some AmazingFeature'
```
 or `git commit -m 'Fixes #issueNumber)`

5. Push to the Branch 
```sh
git push origin feature/AmazingFeature
```

6. Open a Pull Request to main through your github account.

## Before any contribution

1. Sync the code : `git pull upstream main`
2. Sync the code with your remote : `git push origin main`
3. Switch to new branch : `git checkout -b feat/new_feature`
4. `git add <file>` and `git commit -m "What you did in this commit"`
5. `git push origin`
