# Neer Manthan

A mobile application for Ground Water Level Prediction. This was the idea which took us to the finals of Smart India Hackathon 2025 on the basis of the idea presentation and execution of prototype. 

Using the data provided by the government websites such as CGWB (Central Ground Water Board) and NITI Aayog, me along with my team was able to provide a solution for the problem statement PS-1696.
